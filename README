notes: >
    This is mainly a personal project. If you are an independent developer,
    please consider the following TMX libraries:
    
    TiledLib: Supports greater integration with XXA
    
    TiledMax: .NET implementation, no XNA dependencies
    
    I began this project before becoming aware of these two options, and have
    learned alot by reading their source code.
    Any similarities between my work and theirs should be attributed to them.
