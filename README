# TiledSharp README
---
name:
    TiledSharp

description:
    C# library for importing TMX tilemaps and TSX tilesets generated by Tiled.
    TiledSharp does not use XNA, but can be used to interface with XNA games.

license:
    I have not yet chosen a license, although I soon plan to release it under
    one permitting public use and modification.

To-do list:
    - Recast tile gid array as List, with bit-flipped elements
    - Replace List<e> with Dictionary<"name", e>?
    - Testing suite should have a separate project

notes: >
    TiledSharp was written to be independent of the XNA Game Studio libraries.
    If you are a game developer and seek greater integration with XNA, please
    consider Nick Gravelyn's TiledLib.
    
    Zlib compression uses the ZlibStream class of DotNetZip v1.9.1.8.
