# TiledSharp README

name:
    TiledSharp

description:
    C# library for importing TMX tilemaps and TSX tilesets generated by Tiled.
    TiledSharp does not use XNA, but can be used to interface with XNA games.

license:
    I have not yet chosen a license, although I soon plan to release it under
    one permitting public use and modification.

design goals:
    - Parse TMX and TSX files
    - Maximally abstract data without using XNA framework
    - Develop C# programming experience (especially C#4 concepts)

unimplemented features:
    - Objectgroups
    - Layer Tiles
    - Bit flipping flag support?

known issues:
    - In Tileset, firstgid should be required in *.tmx tileset elements, but
      explicity not present in TSX tileset elements.
      The current code does not require firstgid to be present.

notes: >
    TiledSharp was written to be independent of the XNA Game Studio libraries.
    If you are a game developer and seek greater integration with XNA, please
    consider Nick Gravelyn's TiledLib.
    
    Zlib compression uses the ZlibStream class of DotNetZip v1.9.1.8.
