# TiledSharp README

name:
    TiledSharp

description:
    C# library for parsing tile maps in TMX format, generated by Tiled.

design goals:
    - Parse .tmx and .tsx files
    - Maximally abstract data without using XNA framework
    - Develop C# programming experience (especially C#4 concepts)

unimplemented features:
    - Objectgroups
    - Layer Tiles
    - Bit flipping flag support?

known issues:
    - In Tileset, firstgid should be required in *.tmx tileset elements, but
      explicity not present in *.tsx tileset elements.
      The current code does not require firstgid to be present.

notes: >
    This is mainly a personal project. If you are an independent developer,
    please consider the following TMX libraries:
    
    TiledLib: Supports greater integration with XXA
    
    TiledMax: .NET implementation, no XNA dependencies
    
    I began this project before becoming aware of these two options, and have
    learned alot by reading their source code.
    Any similarities between my work and theirs should be attributed to them.
    
    Zlib compression uses the ZlibStream class of DotNetZip, by Dino Chiesa.
