TiledSharp
==========

About TiledSharp
----------------
TiledSharp is a C# library for importing TMX tilemaps and TSX tilesets
generated by Tiled, a tile map generation tool. It uses .NET libraries and is
written C#4 syntax. As a generic TMX and TSX parser, TiledSharp does not use
any XNA Game Studio libraries. However, it can be used as a starting point for
XNA game and library development.

Usage
-----
To import a TMX file into your C# application:
- Inclde TiledSharp into your project, either as source or a DLL
- Include the TiledSharp namespace:
    using TiledSharp;
- Create a Map object:
    Map map = new Map("your_file.tmx");

TiledSharp supports both resource names and explicit paths. A detailed
description will be placed in the wiki.

Licensing
---------
I have not yet chosen a license, although I soon plan to release it under
one permitting public use and modification. Please feel free to use or modify
the code as necessary.

Unimplmeneted Features
----------------------
- Recast tile gid array as List, with bit-flipped elements
- Replace List<e> with Dictionary<"name", e>?
- Testing suite should have a separate project

notes: >
    TiledSharp was written to be independent of the XNA Game Studio libraries.
    If you are a game developer and seek greater integration with XNA, please
    consider Nick Gravelyn's TiledLib.
    
    Zlib compression uses the ZlibStream class of DotNetZip v1.9.1.8.
