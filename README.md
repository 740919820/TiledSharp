TiledSharp
==========
A .NET C# library for importing Tiled TMX tile maps

About TiledSharp
----------------
TiledSharp is a .NET C# library for importing TMX tilemaps and TSX tilesets
generated by [Tiled][], a tile map generation tool. The data is saved as a [Map
object](https://github.com/marshallward/TiledSharp/wiki/Tiled-Map-Class) whose
structure closely resembles the original TMX file, which is managed using
standard .NET C#4 structures and objects.

As a generic TMX and TSX parser, TiledSharp does not use any XNA Game Studio
libraries. However, it can be used as an interface to XNA game and library
development.

Usage
-----
To import a TMX file into your C# application:

- Include TiledSharp into your project, either as source or a DLL

- Use the TiledSharp namespace:

    ```csharp
    using TiledSharp;
    ```

- Create a Map object:

    ```csharp
    var map = new Map("yourFile.tmx");
    ```

TiledSharp supports both resource names and file paths, and should work as
expected in most situations. For more details on loading, please consult the
wiki.

Map fields generally correspond with the XML structure. Layers, Tilesets,
Objects, and Objectgroups can be accessed by either their names or by index
(following their order in the TMX/TSX file). Some examples are shown below:

```csharp
var map = new Map("yourFile.tmx");

var version = map.version;
var myTileset = map.tileset["myTileset"];
var myLayer = map.layer[2];
var hiddenChest = map.objectgroup["Chests"].object["hiddenChest"];
```

Duplicate names are resolved by appending a counter to the name in subsequent
appearances.  For this reason, it is recommended that all elements have unique
names. If you still wish to use duplicate names, I would recommend to access
them by index.

For a listing of all Map fields, see the [Map class specification]
(https://github.com/marshallward/TiledSharp/wiki/Tiled-Map-Class) in the wiki.
